# Lunar-Lander
One of the projects I worked on for 2D Game Dev Class.
We worked on this project for about 6 weeks (roughly half of the semester)
It was created using Visual Studio 2022 Community Edition.
It also utilizes the coding language of C# as well as Monogame templates.
It is meant to have aspects similar to that of the Lunar Lander project at http://moonlander.seb.ly/
There are a number of versions that were created over the weeks with numbers of fixes that had to be made.
